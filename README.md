# CP-Practice

This is where I'll document my CP Practice and Growth, and also note down important points and things I would like to keep in mind, during my CP journey.

Note: I am using an extension called CP-Helper, in order to get the test-cases more readily available in my VS-Code. That might explain some of the files present there.
